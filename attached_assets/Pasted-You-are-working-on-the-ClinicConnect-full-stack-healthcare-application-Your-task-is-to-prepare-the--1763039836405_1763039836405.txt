You are working on the ClinicConnect full-stack healthcare application.
Your task is to prepare the entire repository for a clean production release by removing all development artifacts, placeholder data, mock UI, debug code, and unused files.

🎯 GOALS

Remove all mock data and placeholder fields

Ensure all screens display only real database data

Remove test pages, prototype components, and unused routes

Clean UI and remove temporary text/labels/images

Remove dev-only console logging

Ensure backend routes match production schema

Ensure app builds and runs cleanly afterward

🧹 FULL CLEANUP TASK LIST
1. Remove all mock/demo/test data

Search the entire project for any of the following:

mock data

sample data

fixtures

temp lists

prototypes

placeholder JSON

hardcoded arrays

sample patient, appointment, billing, or prescriptions

AI demo files

test SQL seed data (except schema seeds)

Delete or rewrite all of them so the app uses only real DB queries.

2. Remove demo/test pages

Locate and delete pages such as:

patient-profile-optimized.tsx

patient-profile-working.tsx

ai-consultations-list.tsx

any file labelled "test", "demo", "sample", “working”, “backup”, etc.

These must not ship to production.

3. Clean App.tsx routing

Ensure:

Only real production pages remain

No proto/demo/dev screens

No alternative versions of patient screens

Remove unused imports + dead routes

4. Clean UI placeholders

Search /client for:

Dummy numbers (e.g., 17 patients, +12%)

“No data available” fillers used only for development

Placeholder images/icons

Prototype UI

Temporary loading skeletons that are no longer needed

Replace with production-appropriate components.

5. Remove all console.logs and debug statements

Search for:

console.log

console.warn

console.error (unless true error handling)

commented-out debug locals

leftover TODO/FIXME markers

Clean them or convert to structured error logging only.

6. Backend cleanup

In /server:

Remove unused routes

Remove mock responses

Ensure controllers pull exclusively from the database

Ensure services validate input

Ensure currentOrganization and other global variables are properly defined

Remove temporary logic used by the agent

7. Database schema alignment

Confirm:

patients

appointments

billing

prescriptions

medication reviews

organizations

provider roles

specialty

—all match client expectations.

Fix mismatches and type errors.

8. Delete unused or generated files

Clean safely:

/uploads sample PNGs

old screenshots

early prototype files

unused components

unused utility files

unused Cypress recordings

anything Cursor identifies as dead code

Ask before removing large or deeply connected modules.

9. Final pass: dead-import sweep

Run Cursor’s automated tree scan:

remove unused imports

collapse duplicate components

simplify top-level layout

ensure no circular dependencies

ensure no build-blocking warnings

📦 OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

After performing changes:

Provide a full diff summary

Explain every deletion or major refactor

Confirm the app builds

Confirm the app loads without runtime errors

Confirm patient profile, billing, appointments, and review sections work together

Provide a list of any recommended additional improvements

❗ SAFETY RULES

Do NOT delete:

real SQL schema files

Drizzle migration files

environment variable references

role permissions

production routes

actual medical data types

patient portal access code

organization logic

Before deleting a file that affects routing, ask for confirmation.
