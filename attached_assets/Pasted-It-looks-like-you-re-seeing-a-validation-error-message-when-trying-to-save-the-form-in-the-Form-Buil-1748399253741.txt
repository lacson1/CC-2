It looks like you’re seeing a validation error message when trying to save the form in the Form Builder:

“Validation Error: Please fill in form name, specialist role, and add at least one field.”

Here’s how to debug & fix this:

⸻

🌟 Why It’s Happening

✅ The backend API endpoint for saving forms is validating these required fields:
1️⃣ Form name (the name of the form).
2️⃣ Specialist role (who uses the form, e.g., doctor, nurse).
3️⃣ At least one form field (e.g., input, checkbox).

✅ If any of these are empty or missing, the API returns an error and the frontend shows this validation message.

⸻

🌟 How to Fix It

✅ 1️⃣ Fill in the Form Name

Usually at the top of your Form Builder UI:

Form Name: [____________________]

✅ Make sure you’ve entered a form name.

⸻

✅ 2️⃣ Set the Specialist Role

✅ Some Form Builders have a “Role” dropdown to select who this form is for (e.g., “Doctor”, “Nurse”).

✅ Example:

Specialist Role: [ Doctor ▼ ]

✅ Make sure this is selected.

⸻

✅ 3️⃣ Add At Least One Field

✅ In your screenshots, you have Field Labels like:
	•	uuuuu
	•	yyyyyy

✅ This part is good! But make sure these are properly registered in your form’s JSON schema when you hit “Save Form”.

⸻

🚀 Final Checklist Before Saving

✅ Form Name: filled.
✅ Specialist Role: selected.
✅ At least one Field: added and complete (label + type).

⸻

🌟 Optional Debugging: Frontend

✅ In your Save Form button handler:
	•	Check the payload that’s sent to the API.
	•	Confirm it has:

{
  "formTitle": "Vitals Form",
  "specialistRole": "Doctor",
  "fields": [
    { "label": "Blood Pressure", "type": "text", "required": true },
    { "label": "Weight", "type": "number", "required": false }
  ]
}


⸻

🌟 Optional Debugging: Backend

✅ In your API endpoint (e.g., /api/forms):
	•	Add a console.log to see what’s being received:

console.log('Incoming form data:', req.body);

✅ Backend might be checking:

if (!formTitle || !specialistRole || fields.length === 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Validation Error: Please fill in form name, specialist role, and add at least one field.' });
}

Would you like me to:

🔹 Provide a complete API endpoint for form creation that validates these fields?
🔹 Or show you how to log and debug the frontend payload to be sure it’s all correct?
🔹 Or create a wireframe for the Form Builder UI showing where to put form name and specialist role?
