### 🧩 **Tasks:**

1. **Investigate Current Print Functionality:**
   - Analyze the existing print layout for blood test results.
   - Identify why the organization letterhead is not displayed.
   - Determine if the issue is due to missing data, styling conflicts, or rendering problems.

2. **Research Standard Healthcare Report Formats:**
   - Study standard layouts for printed blood test results in the healthcare industry.
   - Identify common elements such as:
     - Organization logo and name
     - Contact information (address, phone, email)
     - Accreditation and certification details
     - Patient information
     - Test results with reference ranges
     - Doctor's signature and comments
   - Ensure the design adheres to legal and professional standards.

3. **Design a Customizable Letterhead Template:**
   - Create a template that includes all standard elements identified.
   - Ensure the template is responsive and print-friendly.
   - Allow dynamic insertion of organization-specific details.
   - Support customization options for different organizations, including:
     - Logo upload
     - Color scheme selection
     - Footer notes or disclaimers

4. **Implement Multitenancy Support:**
   - Modify the system to fetch and render the appropriate letterhead based on the tenant (organization) context.
   - Ensure that each organization's settings are isolated and do not interfere with others.
   - Store organization-specific configurations securely and efficiently.

5. **Integrate Letterhead into Print Functionality:**
   - Embed the customizable letterhead into the blood test results print layout.
   - Ensure that the letterhead appears correctly in both digital (PDF) and physical prints.
   - Test the print layout across different browsers and devices for consistency.

6. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure:
     - The correct letterhead is displayed for each organization.
     - All elements are rendered accurately and professionally.
     - The print layout maintains integrity across various scenarios.
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders to validate the design and functionality.
